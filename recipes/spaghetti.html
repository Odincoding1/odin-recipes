    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bronze cut spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>Hamburger meat (for a variation, try breakfast sausage!)</li>
        <li>Whole San Marzano tomatoes (Try Cento!)</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Grated Parmasean Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Spices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown your ground meat. Drain grease or use a paper towel to soak it up, then transfer to the side.</li>
        <li>Mince the onion, carrot, and garlic. Use coarse salt on the garlic and smear it with the edge of the knife to create a paste.</li>
        <li>In the cleared pan, add olive oil and sautee the onion and carrot until the onion turns translucent. Add garlic and half of the fresh basil and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add your can of San Marzano tomatoes, and break apart with your stirring device. You may add your ground meat back to the pan at this step. Turn the heat to low and simmer as long as you would like.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and start it on the stove to boil. Add salt until it is salty like the ocean.</li>
        <li>Cook spaghetti according to directions, you are looking for a firm texture but not hard in the center, called al dente.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Plate the sample as follows:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your freshly cooked spaghetti to a plate/wide bowl.</li>
        <li>Ladel a generous serving of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Dust with freshly grated parmasean cheese and freshly torn basil, and a halved cherry tomato, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
