        <li>Take a large pot and boil water. When it is boiling, follow directions of pasta to make pasta al dente.</li>
        <li>On a cutting board, cut bacon into bite size peices.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, add bacon and two tbsp of water. Turn heat to medium level. This will draw out the fat and help the bacon get crisp.</li>

        <li>Return 3 3tbsp of bacon fat to the pan, and add 3tbsp of flour to the fat. Make sure the burner is still on medium</li>
        <li>Continuously stir the flour for 3 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Add half and half a little at a time, and make sure each splash of liquid absorbs into the flour.</li>
        <li>When the mixture finally gets to a thick liquid state, you may add the rest of the half and half.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off in the pan, and add your sharp cheddar cheese. stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add al-dente noodles to the sauce, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop a generous portion of the mac and cheese into bowl and top with the reserved bacon bits. Enjoy!</li>
