    <ol>
        <li>Unwrap your steak and use a paper towel to dry off the liquid.</li>

        <li>Preheat a cast iron or stainless steel pan until it just starts to smoke.</li>
        <li>Pat your steak dry once more with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Add a couple of tablespoons of high temp oil into your pan, then the steak.</li>
        <li>Cook each side for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>add a generous amount of butter to the pan, and place the rosemary on the steak.</li>
        <li>use a spoon to baste the hot butter over the herbs onto the steak.</li>
        <li>When you are satisfied with the steak, remove and leave to rest. season with black pepper and garlic powder at this point.</li>
        <li>The steak will weep for a few minutes, mix with the spice, and when the temperature comes down, it will bring the spice liquid back into the steak!</li>
