# odin-recipes
The final html project on odin.

This will have demonstrated the use of:
using git and github to work with repos and update them on a regular basis
use the basics of html to create a recipe website
Use ordered and unordered lists to describe recipes.
Oragnize files and folders in a heirarchical structure, and point to them within the code
find and source images (royalty free) and add them to the recipes
direct to and from the recipe webpages back to main (index.html)
understand the importance of sizing your headings according to subject matter
preserve some recipes for future use!
